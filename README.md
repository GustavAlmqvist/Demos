# Mypage
Collection of demos, all made within Codeigniter 4 which is why they're .php files and controller and modelfiles are included in the relevant folders as well.

As some projects are made in large frameworks only the files of interest are added to this as it would be cumbersome to add thousands of unnecessary files.

Todo - a simple php CRUD application. To be added: priority selector and colorcoding, filtering.

Counter - a simple javascript counter. To be added: support to add multiple counters, increase by larger quantity and name the timers.

Pomodoro - javascript pomodoro timer. To be added: improve front end design, barebones but functional at the moment.
